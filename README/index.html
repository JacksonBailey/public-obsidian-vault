<h2>Building</h2>
<p>To install dependencies run <code>npm install</code>. There shouldn't be too many since
this project is mostly for hosting textual information. Eleventy (11ty) is used
to build the site. The documentation can be found <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/usage/">here</a>.</p>
<p>To build the site run <code>npm run build</code> <em>(not <code>npm build</code> which is deprecated and
totally unrelated)</em>. The generated site will be be output to <code>_site</code>.</p>
<p>To do that and also serve the site locally run <code>npm start</code>. To stop it use <code>^C</code>.
You may need to do it twice. This will automatically update the site files as
you modify things.</p>
<p>To run a test use <code>npm test</code>. This does a dry run of the build without actually
outputting any files.</p>
